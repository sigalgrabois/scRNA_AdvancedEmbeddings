# scRNA_AdvancedEmbeddings
Enhance K-means clustering for single-cell data analysis by integrating advanced embedding techniques like Universal Cell Embeddings (UCE) and Cell2Sentence. Compare with original data and PCA. Improve K-means++ by adjusting for cell density to maintain performance in high-dimensional, variable density, and biologically complex data.
